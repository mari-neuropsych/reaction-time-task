# Reaction Time Task

Objective:  
Measure the participant's reaction time to a visual stimulus to demonstrate understanding of attention and behavioral responses in Cognitive Neuroscience.

How it works:  
The program waits a random time (1-3 seconds) before prompting the participant to press Enter as fast as possible. It records reaction times for each trial and calculates the average.

Usage:  
Run the script in Python. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the trials.
